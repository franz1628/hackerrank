## Introduction

HackerRank is a platform that offers a wide range of coding challenges and competitions in different domains, including algorithms, data structures, artificial intelligence, and more. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to these challenges as I continue to learn and improve my coding skills.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the different domains and subdomains available on HackerRank. Inside each folder, you'll find the following structure:

- `problem number/` : A folder named after the specific problem or challenge.
  - `sol.ext`: The solution file containing the code for the problem in a specific programming language (e.g., `solution.cpp`, `solution.js`, etc.).
  - `README.md` (optional): A README file providing a brief description of the problem, its difficulty level, and a link to the original problem on HackerRank.

## Getting Started

You can explore the solutions in this repository by navigating through the folders corresponding to different problem domains. If you want to run or test any of the solutions, follow these steps:

1. Choose the programming language in which you want to run the solution (e.g., Javacript, C++).
2. Navigate to the folder containing the solution you're interested in.
3. Open the solution file (e.g., `solution.js`, `solution.cpp`) in your preferred code editor or IDE.
4. Follow the comments within the code for any specific instructions or input/output format.

Feel free to use these solutions as references or learning materials. However, it's essential to understand the problem, attempt to solve it on your own first, and only refer to these solutions if you're stuck or looking for different approaches.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this repository by adding your own solutions or improving existing ones, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Add your solution in the appropriate folder with a meaningful file name (e.g., `sol.java`, `sol.cpp`).
4. If possible, provide a README file in the problem folder to describe the problem and your solution.
5. Submit a pull request with your changes, explaining the purpose of the pull request.

Please make sure your solutions are well-documented and adhere to best coding practices.
